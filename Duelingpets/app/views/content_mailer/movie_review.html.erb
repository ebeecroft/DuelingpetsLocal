     <p>Greetings Review Team we have a director by the name of
        <%= @movie.user.vname %> who has created a new movie for
        the site. I'd like you all to take the time to look
        through the movie to see if it is appropriate.
     </p>
     <p>If you feel that the director has done a really good
        job with it and the content is appropriate then
        please click the approve button. However if you feel
        that it doesn't seem to be appropriate then click the
        deny button. However above all you should use your
        best judment.
