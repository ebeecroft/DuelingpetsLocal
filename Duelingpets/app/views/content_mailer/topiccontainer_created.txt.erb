The container <%= @topiccontainer.title %> has been added to the forum <%= @topiccontainer.forum.name %>.
===============================================
 
Hello <%= @topiccontainer.user.vname %> I am glad to see you are contributing to the forum
community of <%= @topiccontainer.forum.name %>. Its quite small at the moment, but with each
additional member that is added to this forum makes it that much greater.
I really enjoy seeing the community grow for each of these forums, it makes me feel quite
proud. I am certain the forum owner and the mods are quite happy too.

If you have any questions about the forum itself, you can ask the forum owner to lend you
a hand. Now just to let you know only the forum owner and the mods can create
topiccontainers for a forum since it tends to be too difficult for the other
users. The other reason is to cut down on the spam bots as this used to be
a big problem with the older version of the site in the past.

Since you have taken the time to contribute to the forum community it seems
best that I throw you a bone. As a reward I have decided to give you
<%= @points %> points. I know it might not be much but I hope you can put
these points to good use. Feel free to continue to contribute to the many
different forums of this great website.
