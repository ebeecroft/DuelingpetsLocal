New Bot <%= @registration.vname %> was discovered by the review team.
===============================================

Hello Admin we the review team discovered this new bot while going
through the review process. Some of the attributes appeared to be very
suspicious so we denied it entry and sent the information directly to
you.

The data from this bot can now be used to stop other future bots
from entering in to the site. We do appreciate this new mechanism
that you set up as it helps manage the site better and keep it
clean.


Name: <%= @registration.first_name %><%= @registration.last_name %>
Email: <%= @registration.email %> Vname: <%= @registration.vname %>
Login_id: <%= @registration.login_id %>
Country: <%= @registration.country %>
Country timezone: <%= @registration.country_timezone %>
Birthday: <%= @registration.birthday %>


I hope this information will be able to help you against these bots
