      <h1>Your containermoderatorrequest to the topiccontainer <%= @containermoderatorrequest.topiccontainer.title %> was denied.</h1>
      <p>It appears that the forum owner is not ready for you to become a
         moderator just yet. Not to worry you can always try again later
         to become a container moderator. Simply send another
         containermoderatorrequest and maybe with a bit of helpful
         chatting the owner might select you the next time around.
