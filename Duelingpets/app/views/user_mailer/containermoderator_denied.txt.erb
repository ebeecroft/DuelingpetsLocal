Your containermoderatorrequest to the topiccontainer <%= @containermoderatorrequest.topiccontainer.title %> was denied.
===============================================

It appears that the forum owner is not ready for you to become a
moderator just yet. Not to worry you can always try again later
to become a container moderator. Simply send another
containermoderatorrequest and maybe with a bit of helpful
chatting the owner might select you the next time around.
