<%= @containermoderatorrequest.user.vname %>'s containermoderatorrequest is awaiting your review.
===============================================

Message: <%= @containermoderatorrequest.message %>


If you want this user to become a container moderator of the topiccontainer
<%= @containermoderatorrequest.topiccontainer.title %> then all you have
to do is click the approve button. If you some how don't feel that they are
ready to be a container moderator then all you have to do is click the deny button.

Take your time in the process and try not be too hasty to come to a rushed judgment.
Above all be kind with this user even if he or she does not always agree with you. A
pound of patience goes a long way.
