===============================================

I know you now have a lot of responsibility on your hands now with this
new forum but I want to wish you congratulations. I hope you lead the
users of this forum into a new era and are a good and wise leader.
I am certain the owner made a good call in putting you in charge
since they saw a spark in you.

Best of luck with this newest addition.
