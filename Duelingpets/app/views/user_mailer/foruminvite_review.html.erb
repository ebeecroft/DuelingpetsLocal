      <p>If you wish to join this particular user's forum <%= @foruminvite.forum.name %> all you
         have to do is simply click the approve button. Once you do you
         will be a member this user's forum. Only as a member of this forum will you be able
         to access this invite only forum.
      </p>
      <p>If somehow you feel that the time is not right at the moment you can click
         the deny button which will mean that you don't become a member just yet.
         However the door is still open in the future for you to become a member of
         this user's forum. All you will need to do is await a new foruminvite and
         have it approved if you wish to.
      </p>
      <p>Take your time in the process and try not be too hasty to come to a rushed judgment.
         Above all be kind with this user even if he or she does not always agree with you. A
         pound of patience goes a long way.
