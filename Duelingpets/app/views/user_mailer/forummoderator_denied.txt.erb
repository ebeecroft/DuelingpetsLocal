Your forummoderatorrequest to the forum <%= @forummoderatorrequest.forum.name %> was denied.
===============================================

It appears that the forum owner is not ready for you to become a
moderator just yet. Not to worry you can always try again later
to become a forum moderator. Simply send another forummoderatorrequest
and maybe with a bit of helpful chatting the owner might select you the
next time around.
