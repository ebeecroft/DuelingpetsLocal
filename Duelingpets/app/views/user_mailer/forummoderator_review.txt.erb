<%= @forummoderatorrequest.user.vname %>'s forummoderatorrequest is awaiting your review.
===============================================

Message: <%= @forummoderatorrequest.message %>


If you want this user to become a forum moderator of the forum <%= @forummoderatorrequest.forum.name %>
then all you have to do is click the approve button. If you some how don't feel that they are
ready to be a forum moderator then all you have to do is click the deny button.

Take your time in the process and try not be too hasty to come to a rushed judgment.
Above all be kind with this user even if he or she does not always agree with you. A
pound of patience goes a long way.
