Your friendrequest with <%= @friendrequest.to_user.vname %> was denied.
===============================================

It appears that your interests were not able to connect at this period
in time. Not to worry there is hope that you and
<%= @friendrequest.to_user.vname %> will find some common ground
sometime in the future.

Try not to be too discouraged sometimes these things happen. You can
simply send a new friendrequest to the other user. Try to wait a bit
before you do send a new one, so that you guys have some time to learn
about each other.
