      <h1><%= @friendrequest.from_user.vname %>'s friendrequest is awaiting your review.</h1>
      <p>Greetings <%= @friendrequest.to_user.vname %> a friendrequest from
         <%= @friendrequest.from_user.vname %> has been sent to your inbox with the
         following message provided below.
      </p>
      <p>Message: <%= @friendrequest.message %></p>
      <br>
      <p>If you wish to establish a connection with this particular user then all you
         have to do is simply click the approve button. Once you do so both of you
         will be friends with each other. This friendship is two way, so once it is
         approved then neither person needs to create an additional friendrequest
         between the two.
      </p>
      <p>If somehow you feel that the time is not right at the moment you can click
         the deny button which will mean that you don't become friends just yet.
         However the door is still open in the future for you to become friends
         with this user. All you will need to do is send a new friendrequest and
         have it approved if you wish to.
      </p>
      <p>Take your time in the process and try not be too hasty to come to a rushed judgment.
         Above all be kind with your users even if they do not always agree with you. A
         pound of patience goes a long way.
