===============================================

Message: <%= @maintopicmoderatorrequest.message %>


If you want this user to become a maintopic moderator of the maintopic
<%= @maintopicmoderatorrequest.maintopic.title %> then all you have
to do is click the approve button. If you some how don't feel that they
are ready to be a maintopic moderator then all you have to do is click
the deny button.

Take your time in the process and try not be too hasty to come to a rushed judgment.
Above all be kind with this user even if he or she does not always agree with you. A
pound of patience goes a long way.
