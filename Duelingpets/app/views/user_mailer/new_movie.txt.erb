The director <%= @movie.user.vname %> created a new movie called <%= @movie.title %>.
===============================================

It seems that the director you are watching has just created some new content.
Since your are using the new watch system you will be able to receive alerts
about this particular director before anyone else does. So even if the content is
buried you will be able to still know about the content itself.

The content of this movie is directly below this text.

<%= @movie.description %>

<% if @movie.ogv.to_s != "" || @movie.mp4.to_s != "" %>


   <% if @movie.ogv.to_s != "" %>

      <%= video_tag(attachments[@movie.ogv.to_s].url) %>
   <% end %>
   <% if @movie.mp4.to_s != "" %>

      <%= video_tag(attachments[@movie.mp4.to_s].url) %>
   <% end %>
<% end %>
