      <h1>Password Reset</h1>
      <p>Greetings <%= @user.vname %> we heard that you are
         having difficulty in accessing your account. Not
         to worry we will get you back up and running in a
         jiffy.
      </p>
      <p>Lets see now where did I leave that password file
         for you? Ah that should work, yes it should do the
         trick. Your new password is <%= @user.password %>.
         Now I know it might not be what you are expecting
         but it is kind of all I have right now.
      </p>
      <p>Now young dragon it is very important for you
         to... Whats that word again? Golly I am bit
         forgetful at the moment. *Starts rumaging through
         a couple of different drawers* Hmm I know it is
         somewhere, it is on the tip of my tongue yet what
         is it?
      </p>
      <p>Ah yes that it. You need to create a very imaginative
         password that is both very witty, and convincing.
         Your new password will have wings of its own but
         knowing you I am certain you will come up with
         something. Ahh but that is not anything I should
         know.
      </p>
      <p>Go forth young dragon and spread your wings.</p>
